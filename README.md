In this project, we designed a futuristic learning system that turns education into an exciting adventure using Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Instead of simply reading textbooks or watching videos, students can explore virtual environments like ancient civilizations or scientific labs, solving puzzles and unlocking knowledge through interactive escape-room style challenges. The idea is to make learning fun, immersive, and memorable, so that students actually enjoy the process and retain what they’ve learned. This is especially impactful for early childhood education, where engagement plays a key role in development.

The system is smart too-thanks to AI. It tracks how students are performing and adapts the difficulty of tasks in real time. If a student is doing well, the system makes the puzzles harder; if they’re struggling, it gives hints or slows things down. Everything is tailored to the student’s pace, learning preference, and cognitive ability. We even used machine learning models (Random Forest + XGBoost) to analyze real-world student data—like attention span, screentime, communication skills—and predict how engaged a student might be or how a teacher might review them. This makes the system not only fun but also deeply personalized and data-driven.
